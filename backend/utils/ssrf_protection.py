# validate_url_not_cloud_metadata() resolves the hostname once, but the
# subsequent requests.* call resolves it AGAIN. A hostile / compromised DNS
# server can return a benign IP for the validation lookup and a forbidden
# IP (cloud metadata, loopback, etc.) for the connection lookup — classic
# DNS rebinding.
#
# The standard mitigation is to resolve once, validate the IP, and then
# pin the connection to that exact IP while preserving the original
# hostname for SNI + certificate verification. We implement that by
# installing a thread-local override of urllib3's create_connection.
#
# Caller responsibility: only use safe_request_post() / safe_request_get()
# for outbound HTTP whose URL is provided by an authenticated UCM admin
# (webhooks, SSO discovery, etc.). Do NOT use it for ACME/CDP/OCSP — those
# are protocol-driven and have their own validation.
