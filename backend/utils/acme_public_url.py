"""Helpers for public ACME endpoint URLs exposed to clients.

Companion to :mod:`utils.protocol_url` (same job for the CDP/OCSP/AIA HTTP
endpoints): a SystemConfig-backed public origin override with a request-host
fallback. ACME keeps host and port as separate settings because the directory
must advertise a concrete https origin (RFC 8555 requires HTTPS URLs).

The origin is memoized per request/app context on ``flask.g``: a single ACME
order flow hits ``/acme/*`` many times and several helpers need the origin
within one request — without the memo each call would cost a SystemConfig
round-trip on an unauthenticated hot path.
